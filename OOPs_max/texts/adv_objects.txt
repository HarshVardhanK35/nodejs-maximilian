Advanced Objects
----------------
Note
  - Primitive values are the core building blocks that hold our data,
  - objects (and arrays) are helpful for organizing and working with that data
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

- in objects.. the variables and functions are treated as properties and methods respectively
- internally, the keys are converted into strings
- as keys are converted into strings.. so keys must be of any kind
- when keys are number type the insertion order will be sorted or else the insertion order will be as it is

dynamic property accessing and setting
---
  - we can access properties dynamically using square bracket notation without quotations
  ex:
  const keyName = 'key1'
  console.log(complexPerson[keyName])

    - we access keys within quotes using square bracket notation
      - but here we are accessing dynamic properties

  - every time we can not hard code the properties.. user can choose the properties dynamically
    - const userChosenKey = 'levels'
  - we have to set keys dynamically using square braces [userChosenKey] = 'some-value'
    - const obj = {
        [userChosenKey] = '2nd'
      }
  - we can access this key using.. square braces
    - clg(obj[userChosenKey])

  snippet:
    const userChosenKey = 'levels'
    const obj = {
      [userChosenKey]: '2nd'                  // set dynamic key
    }
    console.log(obj[userChosenKey])           // access value from dynamic key
